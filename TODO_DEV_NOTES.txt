autosave settings for 'midi port names' and 'key codes' and 'user CC names'.

keyboard settings menu

lcd display

fix the cords panel. best solution for now might be to leave params at default value. 
sometimes there are extra bits in the preset dump and it throws the values off.
best solution is to send a single parameter value request for each cord parameter. 
1.send a voice select message. 
2.send the parameter requests 
3.update the ui values with the responses from the E4. 
4.select next voice...
2. ... 3. ... etc


sample names... 
voice creation controls... new voice, delete voice, delete zone, etc


velocity curve visual

complete the cc ctrl panel, save user cc names.

an onscreen midi keyboard?

add rythm options to the metronome? the option to play chords, a chord selector? multiple chords selectors? 4 note/chord selectors? yes! 1,000,000 selectors!

correct some filter parameter GAIN conversion values. update filter parameter Labels when receiving param value from e4 

color themes?


More todo's on the way! i don't feel like typing them atm.



some presets seem to have random bits that are not described in the sysex document, and i've so far 
been unable to figure out a way to detect the extra bits 100% of the time programatically, so they cause the parser 
to error or associate the values with the wrong parameter.
i suspect the extra bits are image corruption from the banks having been copied and recopied because there doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern.
In the file preset_dump_study i've highlighted the extra bits for study in case anyone would like to take a look 
and see if they can figure out a way to detect the extra bits when they appear. there doesn't seem to be any missing bits, just extra bits.
